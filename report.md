### Enhanced Agent Workflow Diagram Explanation

The implemented multi-agent system employs a sophisticated orchestration pattern with **7 specialized agents** (exceeding the 5-agent requirement to showcase advanced capabilities):

#### Core Agents (5):
1. **Orchestrator Agent** - Central coordinator managing workflow between all specialist agents
2. **Inventory Agent** - Stock management, availability checking, reorder recommendations  
3. **Quoting Agent** - Quote generation with historical data analysis
4. **Sales Agent** - Transaction processing, order fulfillment, database updates
5. **Customer Service Agent** - Professional communication formatting and customer relations

#### Additional Agents (2):
6. **Customer Negotiation Agent** - Price negotiation and customer context analysis
7. **Business Advisor Agent** - Performance analytics and operational recommendations

#### Enhanced Features:
8. **Terminal Animation System** - Real-time processing visualization

### Agent Responsibilities and Decision-Making Process

**Orchestrator Agent Design Decision:** 
The orchestrator manages complex workflows involving up to 6 specialist agents with AI-powered request parsing and intelligent routing. It coordinates customer negotiations, business analytics, and animated feedback systems while maintaining separation of concerns.

**Customer Negotiation Integration:**
The negotiation agent analyzes customer context (job type, event type, order size) to determine negotiation strategies. For schools/non-profits, it applies education-focused discounts. For large corporations, it emphasizes volume pricing and relationship building. This intelligent customer segmentation maximizes both customer satisfaction and company profitability.

**Business Intelligence Enhancement:**
The business advisor agent continuously monitors financial performance, inventory patterns, and customer behavior. It generates actionable recommendations every 5 requests, providing insights into inventory optimization, revenue enhancement opportunities, and operational efficiency improvements.

**Terminal Animation System:**
The animation system provides real-time visual feedback showing customers how their requests progress through the multi-agent workflow. Each agent step is animated with descriptive text, creating transparency and professional customer experience.

## Framework and Tool Integration

**Pydantic AI Framework Selection Rationale:**
Pydantic AI was chosen for its superior type safety, structured response validation, and explicit multi-agent orchestration capabilities. The framework's integration with Pydantic models ensures data consistency across all agent interactions and database operations.

**Helper Function Integration:**
All required helper functions are strategically distributed across agents:
- **Inventory Agent:** `get_stock_level()`, `get_all_inventory()`, `get_supplier_delivery_date()`
- **Quoting Agent:** `search_quote_history()` for historical context and competitive pricing
- **Sales Agent:** `create_transaction()`, `get_cash_balance()` for financial integrity
- **Customer Service Agent:** `generate_financial_report()` for comprehensive customer communication
- **Business Advisor:** All functions for comprehensive business analysis
